        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="The-Evolution-of-Web-Brutalism-Dive-deep-into-the-origins-characteristics-and-appeal-of-brutalist-web-design"><a href="#The-Evolution-of-Web-Brutalism-Dive-deep-into-the-origins-characteristics-and-appeal-of-brutalist-web-design" class="headerlink" title="The Evolution of Web Brutalism. Dive deep into the origins, characteristics, and appeal of brutalist web design"></a>The Evolution of Web Brutalism. Dive deep into the origins, characteristics, and appeal of brutalist web design</h1><p>In today’s sophisticated UI&#x2F;UX era, the field of web design is rapidly evolving, and Brutalist web design, as a unique design style, has captured widespread attention. This article will delve into the origins, characteristics, and allure of Brutalist web design, exploring its countercultural appeal in an age that values refined design.</p><h2 id="1-Background-and-Origins"><a href="#1-Background-and-Origins" class="headerlink" title="1. Background and Origins"></a>1. Background and Origins</h2><p>The realm of design includes a relatively recent sub-discipline known as web design, which is rapidly evolving in tandem with the expansion of the World Wide Web. Internet World Stats reports a substantial increase in users, growing from 0.4% of the global population in 1995 to 55.1% by June 2018. Throughout the 28-year evolution of the World Wide Web, the digital library of The Internet Archive has documented a staggering 330 billion websites. Despite the web being arguably the most prevalent form of interaction design today, scholarly investigations into the evolution of web design remain scarce. Unlike the closely related field of graphic design, widely recognized categories or periods are noticeably absent in the realm of web design, as observed by Doosti, Crandall, and Su.</p><p>In recent years, there has been a surge in popularity and interest surrounding two design styles rooted in past web eras. Modern adaptations of these styles are commonly referred to as brutalism and antidesign. Moran (2017) asserts that these trends draw inspiration from the early days of the internet. Brutalism, as she explains, seeks to evoke the unembellished and haphazard aesthetics of the early web, employing minimal design features and embracing the default appearance of websites. On the other hand, antidesign aims to emulate what Moran (2017) describes as “bad 1990s’ design on steroids.” It deliberately lacks visual hierarchy, incorporating vivid colors, intricate patterns, and distracting, often animated, elements. Both brutalism and antidesign can be viewed as manifestations of historical web design eras making a comeback. Additionally, these trends have been distinctly named and are characterized by recognizable design principles.</p><h2 id="2-Analysis-of-Characteristics"><a href="#2-Analysis-of-Characteristics" class="headerlink" title="2. Analysis of Characteristics"></a>2. Analysis of Characteristics</h2><h3 id="2-1-Simple-and-Direct-Layout-and-Color-Choices"><a href="#2-1-Simple-and-Direct-Layout-and-Color-Choices" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Simple and Direct Layout and Color Choices"></a>2.1 Simple and Direct Layout and Color Choices</h3><p>Brutalist web design stands out with its straightforward and simple layout. The presentation of text and elements is unconstrained, arranged in a chaotic yet intriguing manner. In terms of color, Brutalist design embraces strong contrasts and high saturation, making the overall design more eye-catching. This simple and direct design language breaks traditional design norms, offering users a completely new visual experience</p><h3 id="2-2-Casual-Application-of-Images-and-Animations"><a href="#2-2-Casual-Application-of-Images-and-Animations" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Casual Application of Images and Animations"></a>2.2 Casual Application of Images and Animations</h3><p>Contrary to traditional design norms, Brutalist web design incorporates a more casual approach to the use of images and animations. Images may appear rough and primitive, while animation effects can be chaotic yet creative. This casual application of images and animations provides users with a unique perceptual experience, breaking free from the constraints of traditional design</p><h3 id="2-3-Challenges-to-Technology"><a href="#2-3-Challenges-to-Technology" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Challenges to Technology"></a>2.3 Challenges to Technology</h3><p>Brutalist web design often challenges the limitations of traditional design tools. Through clever application of technologies like HTML and CSS, it achieves seemingly impossible design effects. This technological challenge not only showcases the designer’s technical prowess but also provides users with a surprising interactive experience.</p><h3 id="2-4-Attraction-of-Breaking-Traditional-Aesthetics"><a href="#2-4-Attraction-of-Breaking-Traditional-Aesthetics" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Attraction of Breaking Traditional Aesthetics"></a>2.4 Attraction of Breaking Traditional Aesthetics</h3><p>In an era dominated by delicate and refined UI&#x2F;UX design, Brutalist design breaks through traditional aesthetic constraints, offering users an entirely new aesthetic experience. This groundbreaking design style prompts contemplation about design and has become a captivating fashion trend. Users, through interaction with Brutalist design, experience the alternative beauty of design, generating a strong allure.</p><h2 id="3-Analysis-of-Attraction"><a href="#3-Analysis-of-Attraction" class="headerlink" title="3. Analysis of Attraction"></a>3. Analysis of Attraction</h2><h3 id="3-1-Breaking-Traditional-Aesthetic-Shackles"><a href="#3-1-Breaking-Traditional-Aesthetic-Shackles" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Breaking Traditional Aesthetic Shackles"></a>3.1 Breaking Traditional Aesthetic Shackles</h3><p>In the UI&#x2F;UX era, people are gradually becoming fatigued with traditional aesthetics and crave novel and unconstrained designs. Brutalist design breaks through traditional aesthetic constraints, providing users with a unique aesthetic experience.</p><h3 id="3-2-Strong-Personal-Expression"><a href="#3-2-Strong-Personal-Expression" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Strong Personal Expression"></a>3.2 Strong Personal Expression</h3><p>Brutalist design emphasizes the pursuit of individuality, breaking design norms and providing users with more space for self-expression. This strong emphasis on personal expression aligns with the contemporary desire for uniqueness and individuality.</p><h3 id="3-3-Countercultural-Fashion-Trends"><a href="#3-3-Countercultural-Fashion-Trends" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Countercultural Fashion Trends"></a>3.3 Countercultural Fashion Trends</h3><p>In an era dominated by delicate and refined UI&#x2F;UX design, the countercultural nature of Brutalist design makes it a fashion trend. The younger generation, in particular, embraces this bold and non-traditional design style.</p><h2 id="4-Countercultural-Appeals-and-Societal-Background"><a href="#4-Countercultural-Appeals-and-Societal-Background" class="headerlink" title="4. Countercultural Appeals and Societal Background"></a>4. Countercultural Appeals and Societal Background</h2><p>The rise of Brutalist design is closely related to societal background. In an era of information overload, there is a rapid increase in the demand for innovation and uniqueness. Brutalist design, as a countercultural design style, satisfies people’s desire for something different and becomes a collective expression of rebellion.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The evolution of Brutalist web design stems from a rebellion against traditional UI&#x2F;UX design norms. Its unique characteristics and allure become more pronounced in an era that values sophisticated UI&#x2F;UX design. Through a deep analysis of its origins, characteristics, and allure, we gain a better understanding of the position of Brutalist design in the contemporary design field and recognize its countercultural appeals, providing valuable insights for future design trends.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Brage E.
